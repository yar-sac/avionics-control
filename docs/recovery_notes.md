### Redundant subsystems
Each of the following subsystems must implement redundant electronics. For each of the following redundant subsystems, we need to have at least one COTS solution in operation. So whether we develop our own stuff or not, there must always be a COTS solution as a backup.

* arming switch
* sensors/flight computers
* power supply
* energertics and "electric intiators"


### Altitude logging
Official altitude logging must be implemented by a COTS barometric pressure altimeter with on-board data storage, which will provide the official log for scoring.
