# avionics-control
## questions
1. Given the goal/constraints of the competition, exactly what functionality must the vehicle implement?

   - manually triggered motor ignition (launch)
   - autonomously triggered separation event 
   - method of tracking position
   - method of tracking and storing altitude w.r.t a ground reference
   - TODO

2. What is the input and output for each functional block above? This should still be in an abstract form (a description
   of what information is going in and out of the different subsystems).
   - motor ignition: inputs: 'launch' command signal, outputs: 'motor ignition' signal
   - TODO

3. What (generic) sensors/actuators are needed to provide these inputs and outputs?
   - GPS sensors
   - altimeters
   - force generators (?) springs, pressurised CO2?
   - TODO

4. Finally, given budget/design constraints, exactly what hardware needs to be purchased and what software is needed to
   use it? (quantities, names and links to actual components that can be ordered or manufactured)
   - TODO
