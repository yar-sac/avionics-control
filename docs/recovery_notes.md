### Redundant subsystems
Each of the following subsystems must implement redundant electronics. For each of the following redundant subsystems, we need to have at least one COTS solution in operation. So whether we develop our own stuff or not, there must always be a COTS solution as a backup.

* arming switch
* sensors/flight computers
* power supply
* energertics and "electric intiators"


### Altitude logging
Official altitude logging must be implemented by a COTS barometric pressure altimeter with on-board data storage, which will provide the official log for scoring. 

### COTS Flight computers
* http://www.perfectflitedirect.com/stratologgercf-altimeter/ ($54.95, ~£40)
* http://www.aeroconsystems.com/electronics/gwiz.htm (couldn't find price)
* https://www.featherweightaltimeters.com/raven-altimeter.html ($160, ~£118)
* https://altusmetrum.org/TeleMetrum/ (various distributors. Found in italy for €379.99, ~£344)
* http://entacore.com/electronics/aimusb ($115, ~£85)
* https://altusmetrum.org/EasyMini/ (€104.99, ~£95)

They are not all equal:

* Some offer telemetry, which gives the advantage of not needing to recover the rocket in the allotted time window in order to get a score for the altitude reached.  
* Some can fire more powerful chute charges than others - depending on the system we use this could limit our options
* Some can log more than just altimeter data
* They differ in the amount of data they can record, depending on sample frequency, number of sensors, and storage size. Some have enough storage for many flights, others might only have room for one.
* The quality and ease of use of the software will varies; some are going to be much more difficult than others when it comes to getting the data off them and to the scoring tent, and there's going to be variation in how well we can configure them to trigger chute deployment at the right height.
